V!𝑠 W! N!1, and then modified the integral in order to define a function that is defined for all complex values of V!𝑠, except U!eq V!𝑠 N!1, where it has a simple pole.

Taking the limit as F!→ V!italic-ϵ N!0 and F!→ V!𝛿 N!0 one can see that the integral +!O!int O!SUB O!int V!𝐶 U!times O!divide O!SUP O!minus V!𝑧 V!𝑠 O!minus O!SUP V!𝑒 V!𝑧 N!1 O!divide U!times V!𝑑 V!𝑧 V!𝑧 becomes U!times O!minus O!SUP V!𝑒 U!times V!𝑖 V!𝜋 V!𝑠 O!SUP V!𝑒 O!minus U!times V!𝑖 V!𝜋 V!𝑠 +!O!SUB O!SUP O!SUB O!int N!0 C!infinity U!times O!divide O!SUP V!𝑥 O!minus V!𝑠 N!1 O!minus O!SUP V!𝑒 V!𝑥 N!1 O!differential-d V!𝑥 and then the rest follows easily from known identities satisfied by the Gamma function.

V!𝑠 N!1, the contour integral over V!𝐶 is defined for all complex V!𝑠, because the path stays away from the singularity at U!eq V!𝑠 N!0 and from the branch cut along the positive V!𝑥-axis. My problem is understanding why the integral over V!𝐶 does not depend on V!italic-ϵ and V!𝛿, so that we can keep them at a safe positive distance from the singularities for the definition, but we can take the limit for the purpose of evaluating the integral. I know that by Cauchy's theorem we can modify a path of integration (without changing the value of the integral) starting and ending at the same point as long as we do not cross any singularity, but this path starts and ends at infinity, so I am not sure how to rigorously proceed using Cauchy's theorem. Even if I start the path at U!plus V!𝑅 U!times V!𝑖 V!italic-ϵ and end it at O!minus V!𝑅 U!times V!𝑖 V!italic-ϵ for some large V!𝑅, the path starting and ending points change as V!italic-ϵ changes.",

After some research, I found the explicit formula for U!eq O!SUB V!𝑏 V!𝑛 O!divide U!times V!𝑛 U!plus V!𝑛 N!1 U!plus V!𝑛 N!2 N!6. Seeing the patterns from O!SUB V!𝑎 V!𝑛 and O!SUB V!𝑏 V!𝑛, I figured the explicit formula for O!SUB V!𝑐 V!𝑛 would be O!divide U!times V!𝑛 U!plus V!𝑛 N!1 U!plus V!𝑛 N!2 U!plus V!𝑛 N!3 N!24 or O!divide U!times V!𝑛 U!plus V!𝑛 N!1 U!plus V!𝑛 N!2 U!plus V!𝑛 N!3 N!12.

N!0 That is, pick U!eq V!𝑝 O!SUB V!𝑝 N!1. Notice that V!𝑝 is necessarily U!times V!𝐿 V!𝑛 because since U!eq V!𝑝 O!SUB V!𝑝 N!1 implies that O!conditional V!𝑝 V!𝑛 and is the smallest prime that divides n. Therefore, U!and U!eq O!SUB V!𝑝 N!1 V!𝑝 U!eq U!times V!𝐿 V!𝑛 Then, if U!and U!eq V!𝑥 V!𝑝 U!eq U!times V!𝐿 V!𝑛, then U!and O!lt N!1 V!𝑥 O!lt V!𝑛 and O!conditional V!𝑥 V!𝑛 (by definition).

This contradicts the definition of U!eq V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑛.

However, I cannot seem to locate such a theorem, so I suspect my intuition is wrong. Is it?",
