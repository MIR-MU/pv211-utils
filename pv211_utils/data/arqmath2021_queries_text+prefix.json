My teacher solved it by considering two arbitrary points on the ellipse to be vertices of the triangle, being O!interval(O-O) U!times V!𝑎 F!cos V!𝜃 U!times V!𝑏 F!sin V!𝜃 and O!interval(O-O) U!times V!𝑎 F!cos V!𝜃 O!minus U!times V!𝑏 F!sin V!𝜃. (Let's just say V!𝜃 is theta) and then proceeded with the derivative tests(which i understood) But, he didn't indicate what our V!𝜃 was,and declared that these points always lie on an ellipse. Why so? And even if they do, what's the guarantee that points of such a form will be our required vertices? One more thing, I'd appreciate it if you could suggest another way of solving this problem. Thank you!",

        "body": "This is just for fun and inspired by Estimating pi, using only 2s. For a positive integer V!𝑛, let U!times V!𝑓 V!𝑛 denote the minimum number of N!2s needed to express V!𝑛 using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, together with the ability to concatenate N!2s, so for example U!plus U!times N!2 O!SUP N!22 N!2 O!divide N!222 N!2 is a valid expression. Other variants involving different sets of allowed operations are possible, of course. This function is very far from monotonic, so to smooth it out let's also consider U!eq U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑛 U!times O!SUB W! U!and O!leq N!1 V!𝑚 O!leq V!𝑛 V!𝑓 V!𝑚 For example,  U!eq U!times V!𝑓 N!1 N!2 (U!eq N!1 O!divide N!2 N!2) U!eq U!times V!𝑓 N!11 N!3 (U!eq N!11 O!divide N!22 N!2)   Question: What can you say about U!times V!𝑓 V!𝑛 and U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑛? Can you give exact values for small values of V!𝑛? Can you give (asymptotic or exact) upper bounds? Lower bounds?  As a simple example we can write any positive integer V!𝑛 in the form U!plus O!SUP N!2 V!𝑘 O!SUP V!𝑛 V!′ where O!lt O!SUP V!𝑛 V!′ O!SUP N!2 V!𝑘 (O!SUP N!2 V!𝑘 is just the leading digit in the binary expansion of V!𝑛), which gives O!leq U!times V!𝑓 V!𝑛 U!plus U!times V!𝑓 V!𝑘 N!1 U!times V!𝑓 O!SUP V!𝑛 V!′. If we write U!eq U!times V!ℓ V!𝑛 F!floor +!F!log O!SUB F!log N!2 V!𝑛 then iterating this gives something like O!leq U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑛 +!O!SUB O!SUP O!SUB O!sum U!eq V!𝑘 N!1 U!times V!ℓ V!𝑛 U!plus U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑘 N!1 This gives an upper bound growing something like U!times V!ℓ V!𝑛 O!SUP V!ℓ N!2 V!𝑛 O!SUP V!ℓ N!3 V!𝑛 V!… which I think is pessimistic. For example, in my answer to the linked question I show that O!leq U!times V!𝑓 N!14885392687 N!36 and U!eq U!times V!ℓ N!14885392687 N!33 so maybe we can expect something as good as U!eq U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑛 U!times V!𝑂 F!log V!𝑛 for an upper bound. I have no idea about a lower bound, other than to write down an upper bound on the number of possible expressions that can be made with a given number of N!2s. Edit: A related question involving N!4s and more allowed operations: How many fours are needed to represent numbers up to V!𝑁?",

After reading the parts on the differential and its computation in coordinates, I'm still wondering why we would be interested in defining a tangent vector as a map that acts on functions on the manifold and the benefits from acting on smooth functions. The main reason that I can think of is that the collection of derivations at a point forms a vector space, which is we what want for a tangent space. I have also looked at the approach of defining tangent vectors with equivalence classes of curves, but it seems that there's also an action on O!in V!𝑓 U!times O!SUP V!𝐶 C!infinity V!𝑀 going on; we call curves F!: V!𝛾 F!→ V!𝐽 V!𝑀 the tangent vectors, and they have a directional-derivative-like operators that act on O!in V!𝑓 U!times O!SUP V!𝐶 C!infinity V!𝑀 by M!M-1x1 M!R! O!evaluated-at U!times O!divide V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑑 V!𝑡 O!compose V!𝑓 V!𝛾 V!𝑡 U!eq V!𝑡 N!0 This seems really similar to how a vector in O!SUP V!ℝ V!𝑛 defines its own directional derivative, but again, I'm not sure why the action on O!in V!𝑓 U!times O!SUP V!𝐶 C!infinity V!𝑀 would be useful/significant.",

        "body": "I was going through the text \"Discrete Mathematics and its Application\" by Kenneth Rosen (5th Edition) where I am across the definition of equivalence relation and felt that it is one sided.     Definition: A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.   Now let us analyze the situation of what equivalence is meant to us intuitively.  Let there be a binary relation V!𝑅 defined on a set V!𝐴. Now we suppose that V!𝑅 be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.  So we have for O!in M!L-3 V!𝑎 V!𝑏 V!𝑐 V!𝐴    U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑅 V!𝑎 (by the reflexive property of R) if U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑅 V!𝑏 then U!times V!𝑏 V!𝑅 V!𝑎  (by the symmetric property of R) if U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑅 V!𝑏 and U!times V!𝑏 V!𝑅 V!𝑐 then U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑅 V!𝑐 (by the transitive property of R)   Intuitively we can satisfy ourselves with the fact that the above are the necessary conditions for V!𝑅 to be equivalent. So \"if V!𝑅 is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, then V!𝑅 is an equivalence relation\"  Now working our intuition for equivalence relation U!similar-to we note the following.  Let U!similar-to be an equivalence relation on a set A, then for O!in M!L-3 V!𝑎 V!𝑏 V!𝑐 V!𝐴 we have,   U!similar-to V!𝑎 V!𝑎 (by the intuitive knowledge of what U!similar-to means) if U!similar-to V!𝑎 V!𝑏 then U!similar-to V!𝑏 V!𝑎 (by the intuitive knowledge of what U!similar-to means) if U!similar-to V!𝑎 V!𝑏 and U!similar-to V!𝑏 V!𝑐 then U!similar-to V!𝑎 V!𝑐 (by the intuitive knowledge of what U!similar-to means)   Now we see that (1) implies U!similar-to is reflexive, (2) implies that U!similar-to is symmetric and (3) implies that U!similar-to is transitive.  So we have \"if U!similar-to is an equivalent relation then U!similar-to is reflexive, symmetric and transitive\"  From the two intuitive implications we can conclude that A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. and not what the book says. This definition makes quite sense unlike the book definition which says that if V!𝑅 fails to be either reflexive or symmetric or transitive then V!𝑅 may or may not be an equivalence relation, which after all gives a weird feeling.  Correct me if my logic is wrong.",

I would consider these 'appearances' of U!times O!divide N!1 N!6 O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2 to be redundant and ask that they not be mentioned unless you have some wickedly compelling reason to include it. By 'non-trivially,' I mean that I do not want converging series, integrals, etc. where it is obvious that U!times V!𝑐 V!𝜋 or U!times V!𝑐 O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2 with O!in V!𝑐 V!ℚ can simply be 'factored out' in some way such that it looks like U!times V!𝑐 O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2 was included after-the-fact so that said series, integral, etc. would equal U!times O!divide N!1 N!6 O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2. For instance, U!eq O!sum O!divide O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2 F!⋅ N!6 O!SUP N!2 V!𝑛 U!times O!divide N!1 N!6 O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2, but clearly the appearance of U!times O!divide N!1 N!6 O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2 here is contrived. (But, if you have an answer that seems very interesting but you're unsure if it fits the 'non-trivial' bill, keep in mind that nobody will actually stop you from posting it.)   I hope this is specific enough. This was my attempt at formally saying 'I want to see all the interesting ways we can make U!times O!divide N!1 N!6 O!SUP V!𝜋 N!2.' With all that being said, I will give my favorite example as an answer below! :V!)    There used to be a chunk of text explaining why this question should be reopened here. It was reopened, so I removed it.",

        "body": "Apparently O!root U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑏 N!2 = U!times O!root V!𝑎 N!2 O!root V!𝑏 N!2 is only true if a and b are both positive or if a is negative and b is positive or if a is positive and b is negative. In other words, a and b can't both be negative.  Is it possible to algebraically prove this? Or is it just a result of the way the square root function is defined?   I know of 1 way to prove this radical property, but I'm still not sure why it won't work for negative numbers.  Let x = O!root U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑏 N!2.  Let y = U!times O!root V!𝑎 N!2 O!root V!𝑏 N!2  Square both sides for both equations.

V!𝑦 V!𝑥 or U!eq V!𝑦 O!minus V!𝑥    A lot of people will go through this line of reasoning (shown below) in order to justify why a and b can't both be negative.   Considering that mathematicians define U!eq O!SUP V!𝑖 N!2 O!minus N!1 or U!eq V!𝑖 O!root O!minus N!1 N!2  U!and U!eq N!1 O!root U!times O!minus N!1 O!minus N!1 N!2 U!eq U!times O!root O!minus N!1 N!2 O!root O!minus N!1 N!2 U!eq U!times V!𝑖 V!𝑖 U!eq O!SUP V!𝑖 N!2 U!eq O!minus N!1  But this is only a specific instance where this property fails us. This isn't a  rigorous or at least satisfying proof of why O!root U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑏 N!2 = U!times O!root V!𝑎 N!2 O!root V!𝑏 N!2 can only be true if a and b are not both negative.  Note: I just started learning about complex and imaginary numbers and I am no means an expert in  mathematical proofs, so if you do know the answer to this question please try (if possible) your best to answer the question without using too much complex or high-order math that I won't be able to understand.",

For instance in order to calculate the optimal amount of ripple adders so as to minimise the execution time of the addition process: U!eq U!times W! O!interval(O-O) V!𝑛 V!𝑘 U!times V!Δ O!minus U!plus U!times N!4 V!𝑘 O!divide U!times N!2 V!𝑛 V!𝑘 N!4 U!and U!eq O!divide U!times V!𝑑 W!

Clearly you can see that the execution time function is not continuous at all because V!𝑘 is a natural number and so is V!𝑛. This is driving me crazy because on the one hand I understand that I can analyse the function as a continuous one and get results in that way, and indeed I think that's what we do (\"I think\", that's why I am asking), but my intuition and knowledge about mathematical analysis tells me that this is completely wrong, because the truth is that the function is not continuous and will never be and because of that, the derivative with respect to V!𝑘 or V!𝑛 does not exist because there is no rate of change.

Since O!gt O!SUB V!𝑥 N!1 N!0,  it seems obvious that the sequence is strictly increasing and always positive because we are always adding a positive number to each subsequent element in the sequence.

For example if the cycle was a number very slightly smaller than U!plus N!3 O!divide N!1 N!4, then O!SUB V!𝐵 V!𝑛 (sum of O!SUB V!𝑏 V!𝑛) would get larger and larger every four bundles for some time. I believe this should happen for V!𝜋 as well since it is irrational. I'm not entirely sure why but O!leq F!abs O!SUB V!𝐵 V!𝑛 N!3 for most small V!𝑛 though I guess it's because O!minus V!𝜋 N!3 is slightly smaller than O!divide N!1 N!7? Anyway U!eq O!SUB V!𝐵 N!312692 N!4, U!eq O!SUB V!𝐵 N!625381 N!5, U!eq O!SUB V!𝐵 N!938070 N!6, U!eq O!SUB V!𝐵 N!166645135 O!minus N!7, and U!eq O!SUB V!𝐵 N!824054044 N!8. F!abs O!SUB V!𝐵 V!𝑛 does not hit N!9 up to U!eq V!𝑛 N!1000000000 with U!eq O!SUB V!𝐵 N!1000000000 O!minus N!2.",

The specific relationship between U!times V!𝜒 V!𝑧 and V!𝑧 is, U!eq U!times V!𝜒 V!𝑧 O!int U!times O!divide N!1 U!times V!𝐻 V!𝑧 O!differential-d V!𝑧 W! W! where U!times V!𝐻 V!𝑧 is a non-zero, positive and smoothly varying function of V!𝑧. In the context of my Physics problem, for the sake of the interested audience, U!times V!𝐻 V!𝑧 is the Hubble parameter of the Universe while U!times V!𝜒 V!𝑧 is the comoving distance and V!𝑧 is the redshift of any time in the past.  So, let me add what I have done so far:   I start by defining the Dirac delta function in the form a unit step function U!times V!Θ O!minus U!times V!𝑎 V!𝜒 V!𝑧 V!𝑏as, U!eq U!times O!divide V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑎 V!𝜒 V!𝑧 V!Θ O!minus U!times V!𝑎 V!𝜒 V!𝑧 V!𝑏 U!times V!𝛿 O!minus U!times V!𝑎 V!𝜒 V!𝑧 V!𝑏 Then converting this in the form of z using the chain rule as, U!times O!divide V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑑 V!𝑧 V!Θ O!minus U!times V!𝑎 V!𝜒 V!𝑧 V!𝑏 O!divide U!times V!𝑑 V!𝑧 U!times V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑎 V!𝜒 V!𝑧 Using the relation with U!times V!𝐻 V!𝑧, we can write the equation as, U!times O!divide V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑑 V!𝑧 V!Θ O!minus U!times V!𝑎 V!𝜒 V!𝑧 V!𝑏 O!divide U!times V!𝐻 V!𝑧 V!𝑎 Also, U!times V!𝜒 V!𝑧 can also be replaced by the integral as well, so that left side containing the unit step function can be written as, U!times O!divide U!times V!𝐻 V!𝑧 V!𝑎 O!divide V!𝑑 U!times V!𝑑 V!𝑧 V!Θ O!minus U!times V!𝑎 +!O!SUB O!SUP O!SUB O!int N!0 V!𝑧 U!times O!divide N!1 U!times V!𝐻 O!SUP V!𝑧 V!′ O!differential-d O!SUP V!𝑧 V!′ V!𝑏.
