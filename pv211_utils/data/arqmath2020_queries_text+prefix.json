I was assuming that this proof would be elementary since my current class in an algorithm cours, but after the few basic attempts I've tried it didn't look promising. Here's a couple approaches I thought of:    (reverse engineer)  To arrive at the conclusion we would need  U!eq O!minus U!times V!𝑟 V!𝑞 N!1 U!times V!𝑘 V!𝑝  for some V!𝑘. A little manipulation:  U!eq O!minus U!times V!𝑞 V!𝑟 U!times V!𝑘 V!𝑝 N!1  That looks familiar, but I can't see anything from it.    (sum on V!𝑟)    which looks good but I don't know how to incorporate V!𝑟 int0 the final equality.      (Wilson's Theorem—proved by Lagrange)    I vaguely recall this theorem, but I was looking at it in an old book and it wasn't easy to see how we arrived there. Anyways, V!𝑝 is prime iff U!equivalent O!factorial O!minus V!𝑝 N!1 O!rem O!minus N!1 V!𝑝  Here the V!𝑟 multiplier is built in to the factorial expression so I was thinking of adding N!2 to either side  U!equivalent U!plus O!factorial O!minus V!𝑝 N!1 N!2 O!rem N!1 V!𝑝  which is a dead end (pretty sure). But then I was thinking, maybe multiplying Wilson't Thm by U!plus V!𝑝 N!1? Then getting  U!eq U!times U!plus V!𝑝 N!1 O!factorial O!minus V!𝑝 N!1 O!rem O!minus U!plus V!𝑝 N!1 V!𝑝  which I think results in  U!eq U!times U!plus V!𝑝 N!1 O!factorial O!minus V!𝑝 N!1 O!rem N!1 V!𝑝  of which V!𝑟 is a multiple and V!𝑞 is obvious. But I'm not sure if that's valid.",

N!1      So, far I've tried a few things, but nothing seems to stick. Clearly O!leq V!𝑥 U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 and since both sides of the inequality are positive, the inequality O!leq O!SUP V!𝑥 V!𝑘 O!SUP U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 V!𝑘 will hold for O!geq V!𝑘 N!1. Similarly, O!leq O!SUP V!𝑦 V!𝑘 O!SUP U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 V!𝑘. Adding both inequalities together, we obtain: O!leq U!plus O!SUP V!𝑥 V!𝑘 O!SUP V!𝑦 V!𝑘 U!times N!2 O!SUP U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 V!𝑘. While this is close, of course, it is not what we want to show.  Alternatively, I was thinking that if we fix O!geq M!L-2 V!𝑥 V!𝑦 N!0, let U!eq U!times V!𝑓 V!𝑘 O!SUP U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 V!𝑘, and let U!eq U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑘 U!plus O!SUP V!𝑥 V!𝑘 O!SUP V!𝑦 V!𝑘, we can show using the binomial theorem that O!geq O!SUP U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 V!𝑟 U!plus O!SUP V!𝑥 V!𝑟 O!SUP V!𝑦 V!𝑟 for all O!in V!𝑟 U!times T!\\mathbb O!SUP V!𝑍 U!plus. Then, if we can show both V!𝑓 and V!𝑔 intersect only when U!eq V!𝑘 N!1, we might have better luck proving the statement since then we would have M!L-2 U!times O!SUP U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 V!𝑟 V!& V!𝑔 V!𝑡 U!plus O!SUP V!𝑥 V!𝑟 O!SUP V!𝑦 V!𝑟 for all positive integers O!geq V!𝑟 N!2. A real number O!notin V!𝑚 U!times T!\\mathbb V!𝑍 with the property that U!eq U!times V!𝑓 V!𝑚 U!times V!𝑔 V!𝑚 could not then exist since then that would violate the fact that U!eq V!𝑘 N!1 is the only intersection. We could then invoke the continuity of V!𝑓 and V!𝑔 together with the fact that M!L-2 U!times O!SUP U!plus V!𝑥 V!𝑦 V!𝑟 V!& V!𝑔 V!𝑡 U!plus O!SUP V!𝑥 V!𝑟 O!SUP V!𝑦 V!𝑟 for all positive integers O!geq V!𝑟 N!2 to obtain our result. Of course, all of this is dependent on rigorously showing that V!𝑓 and V!𝑔 intersect only when U!eq V!𝑘 N!1.  Otherwise, I'm running low on ideas. Any hints would be greatly appreciated.",

If U!eq U!times V!𝑎 V!𝑏 N!1 then O!geq U!plus V!𝑎 V!𝑏 N!2   For example, the case for U!eq V!𝑛 N!3 can be proven like this:  Let O!in M!L-3 V!𝑎 V!𝑏 V!𝑐 U!times T!\\Bbb O!SUP V!𝑅 U!plus. Then we have:  U!eq U!times U!plus V!𝑎 V!𝑏 V!𝑐 U!plus O!divide N!1 V!𝑎 O!divide N!1 V!𝑏 O!divide N!1 V!𝑐 U!plus N!1 O!divide V!𝑎 V!𝑏 O!divide V!𝑎 V!𝑐 O!divide V!𝑏 V!𝑎 N!1 O!divide V!𝑏 V!𝑐 O!divide V!𝑐 V!𝑎 O!divide V!𝑐 V!𝑏 N!1  U!eq W! U!plus N!3 U!plus O!divide V!𝑎 V!𝑏 O!divide V!𝑏 V!𝑎 U!plus O!divide V!𝑎 V!𝑐 O!divide V!𝑐 V!𝑎 U!plus O!divide V!𝑏 V!𝑐 O!divide V!𝑐 V!𝑏  By lemma 1, O!geq U!plus O!divide V!𝑎 V!𝑏 O!divide V!𝑏 V!𝑎 N!2,  O!geq U!plus O!divide V!𝑎 V!𝑐 O!divide V!𝑐 V!𝑎 N!2 and  O!geq U!plus O!divide V!𝑏 V!𝑐 O!divide V!𝑐 V!𝑏 N!2 , therefore:    However I'm not sure the generalized version for all natural V!𝑛 is true. I can't come up with a counterexample and when I try to prove it by induction I get stuck.  Here is my attempt:  Let E! O!fragments -!p E! O!fragments V!( -!n V!) V!: V!: E! O!fragments V!( O!SUP O!SUB O!sum U!eq V!𝑖 N!1 V!𝑛 O!SUB V!𝑎 V!𝑖 V!) E! O!fragments V!( O!SUP O!SUB O!sum U!eq V!𝑖 N!1 V!𝑛 O!divide N!1 O!SUB V!𝑎 V!𝑖 V!) O!geq O!SUP V!𝑛 N!2  Base case:  , so U!times V!𝑃 N!1 is true.  Inductive hypothesis:  I assume U!times V!𝑃 V!𝑛 is true.  Inductive step:  U!eq U!times +!O!SUB O!SUP O!SUB O!sum U!eq V!𝑖 N!1 U!plus V!𝑛 N!1 O!SUB V!𝑎 V!𝑖 +!O!SUB O!SUP O!SUB O!sum U!eq V!𝑖 N!1 U!plus V!𝑛 N!1 O!divide N!1 O!SUB V!𝑎 V!𝑖 U!times M!D-lsqb;&rsqb; U!plus +!O!SUB O!SUP O!SUB O!sum U!eq V!𝑖 N!1 V!𝑛 O!SUB V!𝑎 V!𝑖 O!SUB V!𝑎 U!plus V!𝑛 N!1 M!D-lsqb;&rsqb; U!plus +!O!SUB O!SUP O!SUB O!sum U!eq V!𝑖 N!1 V!𝑛 O!divide N!1 O!SUB V!𝑎 V!𝑖 O!divide N!1 O!SUB V!𝑎 U!plus V!𝑛 N!1  U!eq W!
