This solves a problem that is quite a drawback for TF-IDF.\n",

We can extract them from top documents that were already retrieved. The `search` function of the `RetrieverSystem` class chooses the best fit among the documents, then uses TF-DF to extract top-k sentences from this document. The class parameter `top_k_sentences` defines how many sentences will be added to the query. The number of iteration of this process is defined by `no_query_expansion`\n",

    "Below you can see how the results change if you use **query expansion**. See how documents 2 and 3 swapped after applying the query extension. This is because the document about Sam mentions donuts in several sentences."

    "Now, we move beyond individual models to retrieval and ranking systems, which bring everything together to answer queries by efficiently searching a large collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern IR pipelines often use a two-stage architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1️. Retriever stage (Dense retrieval) \n",
    "– Quickly narrows down thousands or millions of candidate documents to the most promising ones using vector similarities.\n",

    "– Precisely scores the top candidates by jointly considering the full text of each document and the query.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both systems that we have (`RankerSystem` and `RerankerSystem`) use this architecture, but in slightly different ways. \n",
    "\n",

    "1. encodes all documents with a SentenceTransformer and stores their embeddings in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. computes cosine similarities directly between the query embedding and all stored document embeddings.\n",

    "*CrossEncoder jointly scores query-document pairs for deeper semantic understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. instead of storing embeddings in memory, it adds them to a vector database (e.g., FAISS or your own implementation)\n",
