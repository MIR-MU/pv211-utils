In a retrieval system they will find the needed sentence only if the needed keyword (or its normalized version) is present there. These systems are called sparse retrievers. Now we will look at dense retrievers: they use neural embeddngs pretrained on large amounts of data. They capture the semantic meaning of the words. For example, such retreivers can see similarity between words \"lesson\" and \"lecture\", even though they are quite different. A great and famous example of such models are BERT models.

We can extract them from top documents that were already retrieved. The `search` function of the `RetrieverSystem` class chooses the best fit among the documents, then uses TF-DF to extract top-k sentences from this document.
