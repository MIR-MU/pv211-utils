    "# First Term Project: Cranfield Collection\n",
    "“The Cranfield collection [...] was the pioneering test collection in allowing CRANFIELD precise quantitative measures of information retrieval effectiveness [...]. Collected in the United Kingdom starting in the late 1950s, it contains 1398 abstracts of aerodynamics journal articles, a set of 225 queries, and exhaustive relevance judgments of all (query, document) pairs.” [1, Section 8.2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks, reviewed by your colleagues and the course instructors, are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   *Implement an unsupervised ranked retrieval system*, [1, Chapter 6] which will produce a list of documents from the Cranfield collection in a descending order of relevance to a query from the Cranfield collection. You MUST NOT use relevance judgements from the Cranfield collection in your information retrieval system. Relevance judgements MUST only be used for the evaluation of your information retrieval system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   *Document your code* in accordance with [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), ideally using [the NumPy style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) as seen in the code from exercises.  \n",
    "     *Stick to a consistent coding style* in accordance with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   *Reach at least 22% mean average precision* [1, Section 8.4] with your system on the Cranfield collection. You MUST record your score either in [the public leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT0FoFzCptIYKDsbcv8LebhZDe_20GFeBAPmS-VyImlWbqET0T7I2iWy59p9SHbUe3LX1yJMhALPcCY/pubhtml) or in this Jupyter notebook. You are encouraged to use techniques for tokenization, [1, Section 2.2] document representation [1, Section 6.4], tolerant retrieval [1, Chapter 3], relevance feedback and query expansion, [1, Chapter 9] and others discussed in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   _[Upload an .ipynb file](https://is.muni.cz/help/komunikace/spravcesouboru#k_ss_1) with this Jupyter notebook to the homework vault in IS MU._ You MAY also include a brief description of your information retrieval system and a link to an external service such as [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/), or [JupyterHub](https://iirhub.cloud.e-infra.cz/).\n",

      "piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the aeroelastician .   representative applications are described which illustrate the extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .   essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending- torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made . moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .   other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed, but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification of ackeret's formulas .   suggestions are made regarding future research based on the new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic- thermoelastic interaction problems .\n"
