    "# Alternative Second Term Project: ARQMath Collection, Answer Retrieval Task\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÄúIn a recent study, Mansouri et al. found that 20% of mathematical queries in a general-purpose search engine were expressed as well-formed questions, a rate ten times higher than that for all queries submitted. Results such as these and the presence of Community Question Answering sites such as Math Stack Exchange suggest there is interest in finding answers to mathematical questions posed in natural language, using both text and mathematical notation.‚Äù [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Äú[ARQMath](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/ARQMath/) is a co-operative evaluation exercise aiming to advance math-aware search and the semantic analysis of mathematical notation and texts. **ARQMath is being run for the second time at CLEF 2021.** An overview paper (including results) from ARQMath 2020 is available along with participant papers in the [CLEF 2020 working notes](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2696).‚Äù [2]\n",

    "\n",
    "Your tasks, reviewed by your colleagues and the course instructors, are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   *Implement a supervised ranked retrieval system*, [3, Chapter¬†15] which will produce a list of documents from the TREC collection in a descending order of relevance to a query from the TREC collection. You SHOULD use training and validation relevance judgements from the TREC collection in your information retrieval system. Test judgements MUST only be used for the evaluation of your information retrieval system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   *Document your code* in accordance with [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), ideally using [the NumPy style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) as seen in the code from exercises.  \n",
    "     *Stick to a consistent coding style* in accordance with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   *Reach at least 1.2% mean average precision* [3, Section¬†8.4] with your system on the Trec collection. You are encouraged to use techniques for tokenization, [3, Section¬†2.2] document representation [3, Section¬†6.4], tolerant retrieval [3, Chapter¬†3], relevance feedback, query expansion, [3, Chapter¬†9], learning to rank [3, Chapter 15], and others discussed in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   _[Upload an .ipynb file](https://is.muni.cz/help/komunikace/spravcesouboru#k_ss_1) with this Jupyter notebook to the homework vault in IS MU._ You MAY also include a brief description of your information retrieval system and a link to an external service such as [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/), or [JupyterHub](https://iirhub.cloud.e-infra.cz/).\n",
