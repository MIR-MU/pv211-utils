    "“In a recent study, Mansouri et al. found that 20% of mathematical queries in a general-purpose search engine were expressed as well-formed questions, a rate ten times higher than that for all queries submitted. Results such as these and the presence of Community Question Answering sites such as Math Stack Exchange suggest there is interest in finding answers to mathematical questions posed in natural language, using both text and mathematical notation.” [1]\n",

Test judgements MUST only be used for the evaluation of your information retrieval system.\n",

      "No need to use Taylor series, this can be derived in a similar way to the formula for geometric series. Let's find a general formula for the following sum: $S_{m}=\\sum_{n=1}^{m}nr^{n}.$   Notice that  \\begin{align*} S_{m}-rS_{m} & = -mr^{m+1}+\\sum_{n=1}^{m}r^{n}\\\\   & = -mr^{m+1}+\\frac{r-r^{m+1}}{1-r} \\\\ & =\\frac{mr^{m+2}-(m+1)r^{m+1}+r}{1-r}. \\end{align*} Hence  $S_m = \\frac{mr^{m+2}-(m+1)r^{m+1}+r}{(1-r)^2}.$ This equality holds for any $r$, but in your case we have $r=\\frac{1}{3}$ and a factor of $\\frac{2}{3}$ in front of the sum.    That is  \\begin{align*} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{2n}{3^{n+1}}  & = \\frac{2}{3}\\lim_{m\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{m\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{m+2}-(m+1)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{m+1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right)^{2}} \\\\ & =\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2}} \\\\ & =\\frac{1}{2}. \\end{align*}  Added note:    We can define $S_m^k(r) = \\sum_{n=1}^m n^k r^n.$  Then the sum above considered is $S_m^1(r)$, and the geometric series is $S_m^0(r)$.  We can evaluate $S_m^2(r)$ by using a similar trick, and considering $S_m^2(r) - rS_m^2(r)$.  This will then equal a combination of $S_m^1(r)$ and $S_m^0(r)$ which already have formulas for.    This means that given a $k$, we could work out a formula for $S_m^k(r)$, but can we find $S_m^k(r)$ in general for any $k$?  It turns out we can, and the formula is similar to the formula for $\\sum_{n=1}^m n^k$, and involves the Bernoulli numbers. In particular, the denominator is $(1-r)^{k+1}$.\n"
